HMU

Have you ever wanted to quickly find friends to play a spontaneous game of soccer? Have you ever been bored and wanted to know what your friends were up to? With HMU, you can find and create events with ease. Implementing the Facebook API and location services, this app determines which of your friends are within in a certain radius and allows you to send a HMU invitation to them for a variety of events. Your friends will see a list of events they can attend, and can notify you of their attendance simply by clicking on a button. This fun app will make planning spontaneous events quick and easy.
